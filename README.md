Greetings, Code For Vegas Briga-Dears (sp, I know). This is a simple API I created using LoopBack (http://loopback.io) by following the tutorial at:
http://docs.strongloop.com/display/LB/Getting+Started+with+LoopBack. 

If you want to clone the repo and run it in your browser:

1. Have Node.js installed.
2. Run 'npm install -g strongloop'.
3. You shoud probably run 'npm -update' and 'npm -install'.
4. Go to the file location of this repo and run the command 'slc run'.
5. Check out the working API at http://localhost:3000/explorer.

There isn't much there; I just wanted to see if I could get something up and working. Feel free to experiment!
